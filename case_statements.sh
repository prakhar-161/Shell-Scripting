# Case Statement - is used to execute statements based on specific values.
# Often used in place of an if statement, if there are a large number of conditions.
# The variable is compared with the values using the shell wildcards ( ? * [â€¦] ) , NOT regular expressions.
# All the statements are executed for the first matching value until the ending ;;. If no value matches, then the default *) case is executed, if present.

# It enables to match several values against one value
